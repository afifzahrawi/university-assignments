Q1. (Check the speed) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the speed of a vehicle. If speed is less than 
20, display too slow; if speed is greater than 80, display too fast; otherwise, display just right.

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{
	float speed;
	cout << "Enter the speed of a vehicle: ";
	cin >> speed;
	if (speed < 20)
	    cout << "Too slow" << endl;
	else if (speed > 80)
	    cout << "Too fast" << endl;  
	else
	    cout << "Just right" << endl;    
	return 0;
}



Q2. (Find future dates) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for today’s day of the week 
(Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, . . . , and Saturday is 6). Also, prompt the user to enter the number of days after today
for a future day and display the future day of the week.

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{
	int dayNum, elapsedDay, futureDay, multiplier;
	cout << "Enter today's day: ";
	cin >> dayNum;
	cout << "Enter the number of days elapsed since today: ";
	cin >> elapsedDay;
	
	multiplier = elapsedDay / 7;           //multiplier act as a counter to know how many week passed since today’s day
	
	if(elapsedDay > 6)
	      elapsedDay = elapsedDay - (7 * multiplier);
	
	futureDay = dayNum + elapsedDay;
	
	switch(dayNum)
	{
	    case 0: cout << "Today is Sunday "; break;
	    case 1: cout << "Today is Monday "; break;
	    case 2: cout << "Today is Tuesday "; break;
	    case 3: cout << "Today is Wednesday "; break;
	    case 4: cout << "Today is Thursday "; break;
	    case 5: cout << "Today is Friday "; break;
	    case 6: cout << "Today is Saturday "; break;
	}  
	switch(futureDay)
	{
	    case 0: cout << "and the future day is Sunday" << endl; break;
	    case 1: cout << "and the future day is Monday" << endl; break;
	    case 2: cout << "and the future day is Tuesday" << endl; break;
	    case 3: cout << "and the future day is Wednesday" << endl; break;
	    case 4: cout << "and the future day is Thursday" << endl; break;
	    case 5: cout << "and the future day is Friday" << endl; break;
	    case 6: cout << "and the future day is Saturday" << endl; break;
	} 
	return 0;
}



Q3. (Use the && and || operators) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer and determines 
whether it is divisible by 5 and 6, whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, and whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, but not
both.

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{
	int num;
	cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	cin >> num;
	
	cout << "Is " << num << " divisible by 5 and 6?";
	if (num % 5 == 0 && num % 6 == 0)
	    cout << " true" << endl;    
	else
	    cout << " false" << endl;
	    
	cout << "Is " << num << " divisible by 5 or 6?";
	if (num % 5 == 0 || num % 6 == 0)
	    cout << " true" << endl;    
	else
	    cout << " false" << endl;
	
	cout << "Is " << num << " divisible by 5 or 6, but not both?";	
	if (num % 5 == 0 && num % 6 == 0)
	    cout << " false" << endl;    
	else if (num % 5 == 0 || num % 6 == 0)
	    cout << " true" << endl;
	else
	    cout << " false" << endl;
	    
	return 0;
}
