Q1. (Area and perimeter of an equilateral triangle) Write a program that displays the area and
perimeter of an equilateral triangle that has its three sides as 9.2, using the following formula:
area = 1.732 x (side)^2/4
perimeter = 3 x side1

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
const double SIDE = 9.2;
int main()
{
	double area, perimeter;
	area = 1.732 * (pow(SIDE, 2)/4);
	perimeter = 3 * SIDE;
	cout << "Area of the equilateral triangle is " << area << endl;
	cout << "Perimeter of the equilateral triangle is " << perimeter << endl;
	return 0;
}



Q2. (Average sales in grams) Assume a vendor sells 6 kilograms of grocery in 15 minutes and 30 minutes 
and 30 seconds. Write a program that displays the average sale in grams per hour (Note that 1 kilogram
is 1000 grams).

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const double WEIGHTKG = 6, TIMEHOUR = 15, TIMEMINUTE = 30, TIMESECOND = 30;
int main()
{
	double weightGram, time, averageSale;        //time is the sum of TIMEHOUR, TIMEMINUTE and TIMESECOND in hour
	weightGram = WEIGHTKG * 1000;
	time = TIMEHOUR + (TIMEMINUTE/60) + (TIMESECOND/3600);
	averageSale = weightGram/time;
	cout << "Average sale is " << averageSale << " grams per hour" << endl;
	return 0;
}



Q3. (Find the number of years) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the minutes (e.g., 1 
billion), and displays the number of years and days for the minutes. For simplicity, assume a year has
365 days.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int minutes, years, days;
	cout << "Enter the number of minutes: ";
	cin >> minutes;
	years = minutes/525600;
	days = (minutes % 525600) / 1440;
	cout << minutes << " minutes is approximately " << years << " years and " << days << " days" << endl;
	return 0;
}



Q4. (Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings 
account with the annual interest rate 5%. Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. 
After the first month, the value in the account becomes 
100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417 
After the second month, the value in the account becomes 
(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252 
After the third month, the value in the account becomes 
(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507 
and so on. 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account 
value after the sixth month.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
	float monthlysaving, accvalue;
	cout << "Enter the monthly saving amount: ";
	cin >> monthlysaving;
	accvalue = monthlysaving;
	accvalue = monthlysaving * (1 + 0.05/12);
	accvalue = (accvalue + monthlysaving) * (1 + 0.05/12);
	accvalue = (accvalue + monthlysaving) * (1 + 0.05/12);
	accvalue = (accvalue + monthlysaving) * (1 + 0.05/12);
	accvalue = (accvalue + monthlysaving) * (1 + 0.05/12);
	accvalue = (accvalue + monthlysaving) * (1 + 0.05/12);
	cout << "After the sixth month, the account value is $" << accvalue << endl;
	return 0;
}



Q5. (Cost of driving) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the distance to drive, the fuel 
efficiency of the car in miles per gallon, and the price per gallon, and displays the cost of the trip.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double distance, miles, price, cost;
	cout << "Enter the driving distance: ";
	cin >> distance;
	cout << "Enter miles per gallon: ";
	cin >> miles;
	cout << "Enter price per gallon: ";
	cin >> price;
	cost = (distance * price) / miles;
	cout << "The cost of driving is $" << cost << endl;
	return 0;
}



Q6. A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local 
grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk is $0.38, and the profit of each carton of milk is 
$0.27. Write a program that does the following: 
a. Prompts the user to enter the total amount of milk produced in the morning. 
b. Outputs the number of milk cartons needed to hold milk. (Round your answer to the nearest 
integer.) 
c. Outputs the cost of producing milk. 
d. Outputs the profit for producing milk.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const double VOLUMEPERCARTON = 3.78, COSTPERLITRE = 0.38, PROFITPERCARTON = 0.27;
int main()
{
	double milkVolume, cost, profit;
	int totalMilkCartons;
	cout << "Enter, in litres, the total quantity of milk produced: ";
	cin >> milkVolume;
	totalMilkCartons = milkVolume/VOLUMEPERCARTON;
	cost = milkVolume * COSTPERLITRE;
	profit = totalMilkCartons * PROFITPERCARTON;
	cout << "The number of milk cartons needed to hold milk: " << totalMilkCartons << endl;
	cout << "The cost of producing milk: $" << cost << endl;
	cout << "Profit: $" << profit << endl;
	return 0;
}
