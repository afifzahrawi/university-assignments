Q1. (Average sales in grams) Assume a vendor sells 6 kilograms of grocery in 15 minutes and 30 minutes 
and 30 seconds. Write a program that displays the average sale in grams per hour (Note that 1 kilogram
is 1000 grams).

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const double WEIGHTKG = 6, TIMEHOUR = 15, TIMEMINUTE = 30, TIMESECOND = 30;
int main()
{
	double weightGram, time, averageSale;        //time is the sum of TIMEHOUR, TIMEMINUTE and TIMESECOND in hour
	weightGram = WEIGHTKG * 1000;
	time = TIMEHOUR + (TIMEMINUTE/60) + (TIMESECOND/3600);
	averageSale = weightGram/time;
	cout << "Average sale is " << averageSale << " grams per hour" << endl;
	return 0;
}
